# Minecraft Redirect Proxy
This is a project that allows users to setup a proxy where any minecraft client can connect to any remote host. This project would be useful for individuals who want to hide their IP address using a remote server, or possibly allowing an extra layer of filtering for server administrators. 
## Usage
To compile and use, build with dependencies using gradle.
```
gradle build
```
Run the jar and edit config.json accordingly.

## Configuration
```
